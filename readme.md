Lisp dialect mode example
=========================

Saving this for future reference. This is _at least one way_ to comparatively
easily create syntax highlighting for a lisp dialect in emacs.

NOTE: It very well might not be the best way. Apparently there's some kind of
`font-lock-add-keyword` method that I'll probably look into next time I actually
try to do this.
